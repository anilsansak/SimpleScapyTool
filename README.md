# SimpleScapyTool

## Definition:

- In this project, we write a set of Scapy functions which are stored in a Phyton script.
- We design a Graphical User Interface(GUI) for the sake of user.GUI has 5 buttons and a label which displays results.

## Outcomes:

- Saving the results to a file.
- Finding a new result which is bounded to recorded results.
- Learning how to use Python programming language.
- Learning how to use Scapy

## Graphical User Interface(GUI):

- ICMP Button:This button calls icmp( ) function .Then prints the results from text file.
- Port Button:This button calls port( ) function.Then prints the results from text file.
- Router Button:This button calls routers( ) function.Then prints the results from text file
- Web Button:This button calls web( ) funtion.Then prints the results from text file.
- SNMP Button:This button calls snmp( ) function.Then prints the results from text file.

### ICMP Ping:
- The Internet Control Message Protocol is one of the main protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite.It is used by network devices,like routers,to send error messages indicating.

- In this part our aim is to send ping to the IP addresses in specific ranges.We also collected these IP Adresses and we have detected that which of them are open.

#### Outcomes:
- Determine the IP Adresses
- Check if the IP Adress is open or not
- Printing these IP Adresses to a file.

#### Comment:
- If the IP adress gives a response to our packet ,it means that the IP adress is online.If it does not give a response, it means that the IP adress is offline.

### Port Identification â€“ Open Ports
- The program read source addresses from the file ,namely , icmp.txt.Then scan all addresses individually.After the scan ,we found the port numbers which are open and write these port numbers with their services names to a text file.

#### Outcomes:
- Reading recorded result from previous task .
- Scaning the ports one by one.
- Learning how to find a port which is open.
- Printing their addresses,ports and service names to a text file.

- IP addresses which seen at above are shows the ports which are currently open.

### Router & Firewall Detection
- We made a hostname scan.After the scan we list router and firewall addresses which are between the hostname we want and the computer.After that the IP addresses are pushed to a port scaning and the results are saved to a text file.

#### Outcomes:
- Learning how to make Router & Firewall scan.

#### Comment:
- We have made a router and firewall detection scan and we found that the IP adresses which shown above are adresses of routers and firewalls that are between our machine and the destiniton host.

### Web Server Detection:
- Protocols and ports of 10 web server addresses are analyzed.The resulst are saved to a text file.

#### Outcomes:
- Learning how to scan protocols and ports of the Web Server addresses.

- The results which shown above are the results of IP adresses of our hostnames and their port types.

### SNMP Detection:

- Snmp function sends request to snmp port using UDP and receives answers from UDP port 161.Because of that it detects which port is open at which IP adress.

#### Outcomes:
- Scanning and finding hosts adresses having SNMP and ports of each host.

- As we can see ,in our Wireshark output, IP adresses which ends with 30,31,32 are closed.We can see it in our function output too.
